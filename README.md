# hive13-wemos-d1-shield
Motor / solenoid control oriented "shield" for Wemos D1 ESP8266 board.  Developed @ Hive13 during Sparks! electronics night.

It is intended to be a basic shield powered by a single DC power supply.  Drivers and power supply are designed to handle at least 24V to allow commodity HVAC contactors (which typically have 24V DC coils) to be used.  Where possible, reasonable protection was used for inputs and outputs to try to make this design as hardy and resilient as possible.
